                progressive global
                society. The immaculate leadership of former principal of Viqarunnesa Noon School and College Mrs.
                Hamida Ali has been
                an ever inspiration for South Point School and College family. The college has already been able to
                accumulate
                astounding recognition and goodwill under the dynamic leadership of Founder Principal Mrs. Hamida
                Ali.

                attainment.
                We, at South
                Point School and College (SPSC), believe that Schools are living spirits that influence lives of
                students. Our school
                has already proved its worth in turning out academically and intellectually good citizens and honest
                leaders in
                different walks of life. Our very intimate observation and strategic plan in schooling lead us to
                desired goal and
                marvellous success. Our formulated aim to provide pragmatic knowledge through our own creative
                methods
                has strengthened
                our students’ basement to touch the milestone of skyscraper. In Addition, for the vigilant presence
                of
                our Founder
                Principal Mrs. Hamida Ali and our teachers’ unyielding efforts, both the quality and result are in
                constant elevation.
                We have proudly stood as the best School in Dhaka Board based on the SSC result 2008 and we were
                awarded
                as the 9th
                place based on the HSC result 2009.</p>
